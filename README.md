# weather-or-not

## Description

I was tasked with creating a weather app that performed a fetch request to the https://openweathermap.org/api  and in order to do this I needed to pull the latitude and longitude for each location the user inputs.  This outputs a 5 day forecast complete with the Humidity, wind speed and an Icon that represent the weather forecast for the area.
