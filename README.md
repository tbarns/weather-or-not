# weather-or-not

## Description

I was tasked with creating a weather app that performed and fetch request to the https://openweathermap.org/api in ogre to accomplish this task I used a secondary api from https://www.geoapify.com/ to pull the latitude and longitude for each location the user inputs.  This assignment was a challenge since there was no code provided.  I enjoyed styling and laying out the HTML and I got a lot more comfortable dynamically creating elements with JQUERY.  This task challenged me to really understand what a fetch request to an API is capable of.  It took a lot of effort to extract the data and display it but I am quite pleased at how it turned out.
